# Shortcuts

Simplifies a way to open some often used commands

First press `Command+D` it'll register all sub-commands from `eventsMap`. In 3 seconds all sub-commands will be unregistered.

`eventsMap` contains a map of a shortcut to a command.

Run `yarn start` from console, better to use screen do not close it accidentally.
So far the list is hardcoded but might be collected in a file on application path level.
